To follow up with your build in a real-time
Your site can be accessed from local:4000 as default
```
jekyll serve --incremental
```

To post/overwrite to the GitHub Server
```
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push -u origin master
```

If push command is not working, try to force push
(This occurs when the remote contains work that you do not have locally)
```
git push -u origin master --force
```
